<h4>6 Simple principles to build peace in your community</h4> <br>
If you switch on the TV news, open the newspaper or click
onto a popular news website, there’s always news about a
terrorist attack, war, ongoing conflict and a general lack of
peace amongst different groups of people. In an
increasingly globalised world, we should understand each
other better, stand ever more united and strive for peace.
Sadly, the truth is quite the opposite. There’s conflict in
Israel/Palestine, Kashmir, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, all over
the world in fact…
As individuals and citizens, how do we deal with this? How
does this relate to us? How can we make positive changes to enable us to live in peace? <br><br>

<h5>RULE #1: TREAT OTHERS THEWAY YOU WISH TO BE TREATED: </h5><br>
The good old Golden Rule says it all:
empathy, tolerance and peace. This
principle teaches you to love yourself
and love others. It spans cultures and
faiths and is a universal age old
concept which can’t fail! <br><br>

<h5>RULE #2: LISTEN TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY,NOT TO SPEAK</h5> <br>
    Engage in dialogue with an open mind and the real will to listen to
    others. Only then will you be able to understand each other and
    build bridges. Change cannot happen and peace cannot be
    established if people are unable to communicate with others; to
    listen to their experiences and views and show empathy,
    understanding and compassion. <br><br>

<h5>RULE #3: ACCEPT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION</h5> <br>
    We all have different opinions and we may not all
    agree on the same things. Building compromise and
    mutual understanding is incredibly important. <br><br>

<h5>RULE #4: DO NOT FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE</h5> <br>
    <p>Violence is never the answer. Peace can only be
    brought through free will, dialogue, empathy and forgiveness.</p>
    
    <p>Do not stop to same level as someone
    who is violent and therefore continue the vicious
    cycle. This does not change anything.</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes we simply need to agree to disagree and
    recognise that there are different beliefs and forms of
    expression other than our own.</p> <br><br>

<h5>RULE #5: ACCEPT THAT IDENTITY IS FLUID </h5><br>
    Any one person can have multiple aspects to their identity. Identity
    comprises many elements such as nationality, cultural-linguistic
    origin, age and religious beliefs. Identity can and does change,
    taking on many new forms and means of personal expression as we
    learn new languages, move home, adopt new beliefs, marry into a
    different tradition and experience life! Do not put people into a box.
    Avoid categorising people according to and us vs.
    them narrative and remember: we are all singular individuals with
    unique experiences. Such approaches and narratives are highly
    divisive and unproductive.   <br><br>
    

<h5>RULE #6: AVOID STEREOTYPES</h5><br>
    Take people for the individuals they
    are. Avoid misconceptions,
    stereotypes and toxic narratives and
    get to know a person instead. This
    will avoid offence,
    misunderstandings and ultimately
    help you to create a real bond with
    others based on true understanding,
    empathy and trust. After all, no one
    likes to be judged – especially from
    the outside. <br><br>
